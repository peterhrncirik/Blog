    <h1>Books</h1>
    <p> Some of the most important lessons I have learned are from books I have read. <br/> The habit of reading books and writing down the key insights have been life-changing.<br/>
         
    <p> I'm sharing my notes with you, in hopes that you will get as much from them as I have. </p>

    <p> Feel free to add me on GoodReads to see which books I'm reading. </p>

    <p> The latest book is The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey. </p>

    <p> üìï Click on the book title or image to read my notes. I have included a short summary of my thoughts on each book, yet omitted ratings. 
        I do not believe my 1-10 rating sufficiently communicates the value of a given book. </p>

    <p> üîç You can search for a book by title, author, or category. Clicking any of the categories below will filter the results. </p>
